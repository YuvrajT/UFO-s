# Overview:

The purpose of this project is to buld a interactive webpage through which we can filter results based on UFO sighting date, city, state, country and shape. 

## Results:

With the reafactored code, the search method has been made more refined, now by just entering the search criteria and hit the "enter" button, results will show as per the filtered criteria.

## Summary:

### Drawback:

 - The data is limited, we are only filtering throught a set amount of data. 
 - The date is outdated. 
 
### Recommendations:

- To clean up the data: as column duration has few entries by mins and minutes. 
- We could add more styling and make it more user-interactive.
